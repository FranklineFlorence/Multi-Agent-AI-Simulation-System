***Multi-Agent AI Simulation System***

*Overview*

Welcome to the AI Simulation of Autonomous Rovers on Mars! This project models a simulated environment where intelligent rovers explore, collaborate, and navigate the Martian terrain. Designed to mimic real-world robotic missions, this simulation demonstrates decision-making, resource sharing, and environmental interaction among AI-driven agents.

The simulation incorporates various AI techniques, such as pathfinding, task allocation, and autonomous cooperation. Rovers must navigate obstacles, locate and collect rocks, and communicate with each other to complete tasks efficiently—all without human intervention.

*Objectives*

The primary goal of this simulation is to develop and test AI behaviors in a dynamic, unpredictable environment. Specifically, it aims to:
✅ Simulate autonomous exploration in a Martian-like terrain.
✅ Implement AI-driven decision-making for efficient navigation and task execution.
✅ Enable rovers to collaborate on resource collection and obstacle avoidance.
✅ Model real-world challenges that space missions face, such as energy management and communication.

*Key Features*

  - Rover Autonomy: Each rover operates independently, making intelligent decisions based on its surroundings.
  - Dynamic Environment: The Mars-like terrain is filled with obstacles, rocks, and limited resources, creating a challenging landscape.
  - Collaboration & Resource Sharing: Rovers can share battery power, exchange collected samples, and work together to retrieve distant rocks.
  - Adaptive AI Behavior: Agents adapt to their environment, responding to obstacles, energy constraints, and mission goals in real time.
  - Alien Encounters: The simulation can include unpredictable alien interactions, adding an extra layer of complexity.

*How It Works*

  - Initialization: The simulation generates a Mars-like grid with obstacles, rocks, and a spacecraft (landing site).
  - Rover Deployment: Autonomous rovers are deployed, each with a unique ID, battery levels, and exploration capabilities.
  - Exploration & Task Execution:
      - Rovers scan for nearby rocks and determine the best approach for collection.
      - If a rock is far, multiple rovers collaborate to retrieve it.
      - If a rover runs low on battery, another rover may share power.
      - The simulation dynamically updates, ensuring realistic behaviors emerge over time.
      - Aliens will chase and try attacking rovers if it is in the vicinity.
  
  *✅Outcome Evaluation:* The success of the mission is determined based on the efficiency of resource collection, rover cooperation, and overall exploration success.

*Installation & Usage*
